# Snake Game

## Overview
Develop a classic Snake game using JavaSwing, focusing on controlling the snake, eating food, increasing size and scores, and handling collisions with obstacles.

## Features
- Control the snake with arrow keys.
- Eat food to increase size and score.
- Avoid collisions with borders and the snake's body.
- Display score and game over message.

## Technologies Used
- Java Swing library for lightweight window-based applications.

## Development Process
1. **Basic UI Development**: Initialize components like the board, snake, and apple with appropriate properties.
2. **Graphics Setup**: Load images for the snake, apple, and other components from the Resources folder.
3. **Apple Randomization**: Randomize the apple's position on the board for each game session.
4. **Snake Dynamics**: Implement snake movement based on timer triggers and direction controls.
5. **Controlling the Snake**: Implement arrow key controls using a Key Adapter Class.
6. **Final Touches**: Display game over message and score in the center of the screen.

## Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Open the project in a Java IDE.
- Compile and run the code to start playing the Snake game.
